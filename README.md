# Enbious

## Description

An accessible shopping cart app created using React routes.

### Features

-   The main content area is marked as an aria-live region, allowing screen readers to announce when a user visits a new page.
-   Each item in the Shop page is routed to its own details page, where you can add it to your shopping cart.
-   Items show a warning when there is low stock or the item is sold out.
-   A quantity-to-stock check occurs when attempting to add low-stock items to your cart, preventing you from adding any amount that exceeds the current stock.

## Issues During Creation/Misc. Notes

The most difficult part would definitely have to be handling the cart state. It started out a bit rough with trying to figure out how to go about it, but I feel I slowly started understanding the useReducer hook and how powerful it can be when you need it.

That said, using useReducer, as well as the useContext and useRef hooks, was incredibly interesting. As the final project in the React section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), though certainly not the last thing I'll ever make in React, this is still my favorite course material thus far.
