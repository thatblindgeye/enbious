## Description

An accessible shopping cart app created using React routes.

### Features

-   The main content area is marked as an aria-live region, allowing screen readers to announce when a user visits a new page.
-   Each item in the Shop page is routed to its own details page, where you can add it to your shopping cart.
-   Items show a warning when there is low stock or the item is sold out.
-   A quantity-to-stock check occurs when attempting to add low-stock items to your cart, preventing you from adding any amount that exceeds the current stock.
